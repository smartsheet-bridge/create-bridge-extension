#### What?

_Taken from [What the heck is a 'thunk'?](https://daveceddia.com/what-is-a-thunk/)_

> A thunk is another word for a _function_. But it’s not just any old function. It’s a special (and uncommon) name for a function that’s returned by another. Like this:
>
> ```js
> function wrapper_function() {
>   // this one is a "thunk" because it defers work for later:
>   return function thunk() {
>     // it can be named, or anonymous
>     console.log('do stuff now');
>   };
> }
> ```

#### Why?

When writing an extension this is really useful if you are dealing with a third-party library that uses javascript "_callbacks_" for asynchronous execution like this contrived example from the Smartsheet SDK.

```js
smartsheet.sheets.listSheets({}, function (error, data) {
  if (error) {
    return error;
  } else {
    return data;
  }
});
```

The above function will attempt to call the Smartsheet API for a list of sheets available to you, once it has completed it will execute the second parameter, known as the "callback".

However, in a synchronous execution the extension would return before the callback is called. Imagine the following:

```js {4}
export const async anBadCallbackResponse = () => {
  console.log('Before Smartsheet is called');
  smartsheet.sheets.listSheets({}, function (error, data) {
    console.log('After Smartsheet is completed');
  });
  console.log('After Smartsheet is called');
}
```

The output would be the following

```js
// Before Smartsheet is called
// After Smartsheet is called
```

The extension will have returned before `After Smartsheet is completed` could have executed and therefore neither `error` or `data` in this "callback" would have be able to return from the extension.

:::tip Side Effects

This is a useful pattern for asynchronous "side effects". See [Side Effects](../advanced/best_practices#side-effects) best practices.

#### How?

To fix this, an extension function can return a thunk. The thunk is then executed with a single parameter, which is itself a function of type `(response: any) => void` allowing you to pass that parameter around and call it when the asynchronous function has finished.

```js {2,6}
export const async anThunkCallbackResponse = () => {
  return (respond) => {
    console.log('Before Smartsheet is called');
    smartsheet.sheets.listSheets({}, function (error, data) {
      console.log('After Smartsheet is completed');
      respond(data);
    });
    console.log('After Smartsheet is called');
  }
}
```

The returned thunk will execute immediately but the `respond` parameter can be called whenever your ready. You should pass into the `respond` function what you would normally return from a standard function (without a thunk). I.e. the following two functions will return the same value.

```js
export const async basicResponse = () => {
  return 'Hello, World';
}

export const async thunkResponse = () => {
  return (respond) => respond('Hello, World')
}
```
