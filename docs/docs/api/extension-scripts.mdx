import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';

A command line interface (CLI) tool for assisting the development and maintenance of [Bridge by Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/platform/bridge) extensions.

This tool is designed to be installed as a devDependency and interacted with through `npm` or `yarn` scripts.

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "account": "extension-scripts account",
    "build": "extension-scripts build",
    "deploy": "extension-scripts deploy",
    "revoke": "extension-scripts revoke"
  }
}
```

:::tip

If running via `npm`, remember that you may need to use `--` to pass options. See [this GitHub PR](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/5518) for more details.

```bash
npm run deploy -- [options]
```

:::

It can also be ran directly in the terminal.

```bash
./node_module/.bin/extension-scripts <command> [options]
```

### `account`

A set of commands to manage account aliases used with the tool. See [Authentication](#authentication) and [Account Aliases](#account-aliases) for more details.

#### `add`

This command will securely save an account alias to your local machine allowing you to make use of the account alias with other commands.

```bash
$ extension-scripts account add [alias] [options]
```

If no `alias` is given then the command will attempt to store the alias as "default".

| option, alias | description                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `alias`       | Account alias to use. See [Account Aliases](#account-aliases).                   |
| `--url`       | Account URL. See [Authentication](#authentication).                              |
| `--key`       | Authorized API Key for given account URL. See [Authentication](#authentication). |
| `--overwrite` | Will overwrite and existing alias.                                               |

#### `list`

This command will list all securely stored account aliases on the current machine.

```bash
$ extension-scripts account list
```

#### `remove`

This command will remove the given account alias on the current machine.

```bash
$ extension-scripts account add [alias]
```

### `build`

This command will build your extension code into Bridge compatible source code for deploying.

```bash
$ extension-scripts build [options]
```

| option       | description                                                            |

## Options

These options can be appended to all commands.

| command, alias     | description                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--help`           | Show help of the current command.                                 |
| `--version`        | Show version of the tool.                                         |
| `--loglevel`, `-l` | Level of output logs to print. See [Output Logs](#output-logs).   |
| `--debug`, `-d`    | Regex pattern to match debug logs. See [Debug Logs](#debug-logs). |

All options, global or not, can be provided [inline](#inline), as [environment variables](#environment-variables), in a [configuration file](#configuration-files), or as part of the `extension` property in the [`package.json`](#packagejson) file and are prioritized in the following order:

1. Inline arguments
2. Environment variables
3. `extension` property of `package.json`
4. Configuration file
   1. `.extensionrc`
   2. `.extensionrc.json`
   3. `.extensionrc.yaml`
   4. `.extensionrc.yml`
   5. `.extensionrc.js`

### Inline

Inline options take priority over other methods and come directly after the `[command]` formatted like `--[option]=[value]`.

Some inline options have an alias that shorten the format to `-[alias] [value]`. E.g. `--minutes=5` becomes `-m 5`.

:::tip

You can see all the options available for any command by running the command with the `--help` option like

```
extensions-scripts deploy --help
```

:::

### Environment Variables

:::note

this section describes ENV variables for supplying options in your development environment.

:::

Options can be configured via environment variables and come in the format of uppercase and prepended with `EXTENSION_`. E.g. `--url=[account url]` becomes `EXTENSION_URL:[url]`. Environment variables take priority over all but inline options.

### Configuration files

Options can be configured as part of a configuration file in JSON or YAML.

**JSON**

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.converse.ai"
}
```

**YAML**

```yml
url: https://example.converse.ai
```

:::tip

Configuration files can be extended using the `extends` property. This can be set to a local file, or an NPM module.

:::

### `package.json`

Configuration options can also be read from the `extension` property of your `package.json` file. The structure is exactly the same as the JSON configuration structure above.

```json
{
  //...
  "extension": {
    "url": "https://example.converse.ai"
  }
}
```

:::tip

The `extension` property can be extended using the `extends` property. This can be set to a local file, or an NPM module.

# Guides

## Authentication

To authenticate with your Bridge by Smartsheet platform you need to supply a URL and API Key using the options `--url` and `--key` respectively. E.g.

```bash
$ extension-scripts --url=[account url] --key=[account api key]
```

**`--url`**

Use this option to provide the URL of your Bridge by Smartsheet account in the form of `https://example.bridge.smartsheet.com`.

_This is the same URL that you visit in the browser when accessing the Bridge by Smartsheet app._

```bash
$ extension-scripts deploy --url=https://example.bridge.smartsheet.com
```

**`--key`**

Use this option to provide an authorized API Key for the given URL in the form of `XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX`.

_You can access these via the Bridge by Smartsheet user interface by clicking on the user icon in the top right-hand corner, and choosing "API Keys". From there you may copy an existing key or create a new one._

```bash
$ extension-scripts deploy --key=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

:::warning

These keys provide the holder with full access to your Bridge by Smartsheet account. DO NOT commit these keys to any git repository.

:::

## Account Aliases

You can securely store account URLs and API Keys for future use using Account Aliases. This can be incredibly useful if you have multiple accounts or multiple extensions that you need to deploy regularly.

To store account details you can use the `account add` command.

```bash
$ extension-scripts account add example --url=https://example.bridge.smartsheet.com --key=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Where `example` is the alias chosen by you for later use. Once stored, this alias can be used with any extension on this machine allowing you to drop the `--url` and `--key` arguments.

```bash
$ extension-scripts deploy example
```

_Note that `--url` and `--key` parameters are still prioritized over account aliases._

## Output Logs

When each command runs it will print out various logs to the command line interface at different levels of severity ranked in importance by `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `VERBOSE`. These can be filtered using the `--loglevel` option and is defaulted to `INFO` meaning all `INFO` level logs and above (`ERROR`, `WARN`) will appear in the CLI.

There are five log levels to choose from.

| Level     | Severity shown                      |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `SILENCE` | -                                   |
| `ERROR`   | `ERROR`                             |
| `WARN`    | `ERROR`, `WARN`                     |
| `INFO`    | `ERROR`, `WARN` , `INFO`            |
| `VERBOSE` | `ERROR`, `WARN` , `INFO`, `VERBOSE` |

:::note

Changing the `--loglevel` option does not affect `extension.log` output. All severities of the output log and all debug logs will be printed in this file.

:::

## Debug Logs

Debug logs are always stored in the `extension.log` file by default but if you want to print them in the CLI then you can use the `--debug` option and pass a regular expression. E.g. `--debug=.*` will print all debug statements to the CLI

:::note

Changing the `--debug` option does not affect `extension.log` output. All severities of the output log and all debug logs will be printed in this file.
