A Bridge extension is an extension that consists of some very specific functionality to extend Bridge By Smartsheet.

## Prerequisite

Bridge extensions are built on top of the extension core concepts so this documentation assumes you are familiar with the [main concepts](/concepts/introduction).

## Project Structure

The smallest Bridge extension consists of three files.

```bash {4}
example
├── index.js
├── package.json
└── extension.json
```

Along with `index.js` and `package.json` needed for all extensions the only extra file necessary for Bridge is the `extension.json` file. This static configuration file is often referred to as the "specification file" or "spec file" and is used to define the extension to the Bridge platform.

### `extensions.json`

```json
{
  "name": "myExtension",
  "displayName": "My Extension",
  "description": "This is an example Bridge Extension.",
  "documentLink": "",
  "providerData": [],
  "module": [],
  "webhooks": []
}
```

In this next chapter of this guide we dig deeper into the spec file and each of the properties.
