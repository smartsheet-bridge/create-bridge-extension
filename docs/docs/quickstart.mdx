## Create Extension

:::note

To start developing you will need `NodeJS` installed on your development machine along with either `npm` or `yarn` and good knowledge of developing `JavaScript` or `TypeScript` applications and services.

:::

The recommended way to start developing a new Extension is to use the official `create-bridge-extension` tool along with either `npm` or `yarn` to scaffold a new extension project.

<Tabs
groupId="js2ts"
defaultValue="js"
values={[
  { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="js">


Use `npm`

```bash
npx @smartsheet-bridge/create-extension hello_world
```

or `yarn`

```bash
yarn create @smartsheet-bridge/extension hello_world
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts">


Use `npm`

```bash
npx @smartsheet-bridge/create-extension hello_world --template=ts
```

or `yarn`

```bash
yarn create @smartsheet-bridge/extension hello_world --template=ts
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


The tool will scaffold a very basic, but complete, extension project in the folder `hello_world`. This extension is ready to be deployed.

## Deploy Extension

:::note

To deploy an extension on Bridge by Smartsheet you will need an account.

:::

To deploy an extension created with the `create-bridge-extension` tool simply run the following command from the project directory where `<insert url here>` is the url of your Bridge by Smartsheet account that you can find in the browser when viewing the application, and `<insert key here>` is an API key that can be generated in your Bridge by Smartsheet account.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run deploy --url=<insert url here> --key=<insert key here>
```
